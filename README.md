# Week One & Done: Homework Assignment #1

## Description
This week's challenge focuses on assessibility, organization and refactoring code. I am refactoring existing code to meet the standards provided:
* Find semantic HTML elements
* Find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Find accessible alt attributes
* The heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Find a concise, descriptive title

### End Product 
Below is a screenshot of what the initial website looks like and what it should still look like once all the code has been refractored.
